# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Cryptomus payment gateway integration needs to be fixed and properly configured to enable cryptocurrency payments for the LearnforLess course platform. The system should allow users to purchase courses using cryptocurrency through Cryptomus, with proper webhook handling for payment verification and automatic course access provisioning.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to pay for courses using cryptocurrency through Cryptomus, so that I can have an alternative payment method with better pricing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects Cryptomus payment method THEN the system SHALL create a valid Cryptomus invoice
2. WHEN the invoice is created THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the Cryptomus payment page
3. WHEN the user completes payment THEN the system SHALL receive webhook notification and update order status
4. IF payment is successful THEN the system SHALL grant immediate course access
5. WHEN using Cryptomus THEN the user SHALL pay $12.99 instead of $14.99 (Gumroad price)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling and logging for Cryptomus integration, so that I can troubleshoot payment issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Cryptomus API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
3. WHEN webhook verification fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure and not process the payment
4. IF API credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL return user-friendly error messages
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL fallback gracefully without breaking the checkout flow

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper configuration management for Cryptomus credentials, so that the integration is secure and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the application THEN all sensitive credentials SHALL be stored in Supabase secrets
2. WHEN accessing Cryptomus API THEN the system SHALL use proper signature generation
3. WHEN receiving webhooks THEN the system SHALL verify signatures for security
4. IF environment configuration is incorrect THEN the system SHALL provide clear setup instructions
5. WHEN updating credentials THEN the system SHALL not require code changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a customer, I want reliable order tracking and status updates, so that I know the status of my payment and course access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an order is created THEN the system SHALL store it in the database with pending status
2. WHEN payment is completed THEN the system SHALL update order status to completed
3. WHEN payment fails THEN the system SHALL update order status to failed
4. IF webhook is received THEN the system SHALL match it to the correct order
5. WHEN order status changes THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trail of updates
