# Base Network Direct Payment Setup Guide

## 🚀 Current Status
✅ **Frontend Integration**: Direct wallet payment implemented  
✅ **Database Integration**: Order tracking in Supabase  
✅ **Payment Page**: Custom Base payment interface  
✅ **Anonymous Payments**: No merchant account required  

## 🔧 What You Need to Do

### 1. Set Your Base Wallet Address
Update your receiving wallet address in `src/lib/basepay.ts`:

```typescript
// Your Base network wallet address - replace with your actual address
const BASE_WALLET_ADDRESS = "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D4C9db96590c6C8b" // Replace with your Base wallet
```

### 2. How It Works
- **Anonymous**: No merchant accounts or API keys needed
- **Direct**: Payments go straight to your Base wallet
- **Decentralized**: Uses Base blockchain network
- **Simple**: Users send ETH directly to your address

### 3. Payment Flow
1. User selects "BasePay" at checkout
2. System calculates ETH amount (≈$14.99 USD)
3. User is redirected to `/pay-base` page
4. User can:
   - Open MetaMask with pre-filled transaction
   - Copy payment details for manual transfer
5. User confirms payment sent
6. System tracks payment status

### 4. Verification Options

#### Option A: Manual Verification (Current)
- Users click "I've sent the payment"
- You manually verify transactions on Base network
- Grant access after confirmation

#### Option B: Automatic Verification (Advanced)
You can implement automatic verification by:

1. **Using Base RPC to monitor your wallet**:
```javascript
// Monitor incoming transactions to your address
const checkTransaction = async (address, amount, blockNumber) => {
  // Query Base network for transactions
  // Verify amount and sender
  // Auto-approve orders
}
```

2. **Using a blockchain indexer service**:
- Moralis, Alchemy, or similar
- Set up webhooks for incoming transactions
- Automatically update order status

### 5. Current Features

2. **Currency**: Payments in ETH on Base network
3. **Anonymous**: No KYC or merchant registration required
4. **Direct**: Funds go straight to your wallet
5. **Gas Fees**: Lower than Ethereum mainnet
6. **Speed**: Fast transaction confirmation

## 🎯 Setup Steps

### 1. Update Wallet Address
```typescript
// In src/lib/basepay.ts
const BASE_WALLET_ADDRESS = "YOUR_BASE_WALLET_ADDRESS_HERE"
```

### 2. Test Payment Flow
1. Go to `http://localhost:8080/checkout`
2. Select "BasePay" payment method
3. Enter email and click "Buy Now"
4. Test the payment page functionality

### 3. Monitor Your Wallet
- Use [BaseScan](https://basescan.org/) to monitor transactions
- Set up notifications for incoming payments
- Verify payment amounts match orders

### 4. Grant Access
- Check payment confirmations
- Update order status to "completed"
- Send course access to customers

## 💡 Advanced Features (Optional)

### Automatic Payment Verification
```javascript
// Example: Monitor Base network for payments
const monitorPayments = async () => {
  // Use Base RPC or indexer service
  // Check for transactions to your address
  // Verify amounts and update orders
}
```

### Price Oracle Integration
```javascript
// Example: Real-time ETH price
const getETHPrice = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids=ethereum&vs_currencies=usd')
  const data = await response.json()
  return data.ethereum.usd
}
```

This setup gives you a completely decentralized, anonymous payment system that requires no merchant accounts or API keys!
